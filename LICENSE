6.	Confidentiality.  
6.1.	Definition.  “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by one party (“Discloser”) to the other (“Recipient”), directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, which is designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary" or some similar designation, or learned by Recipient under circumstances in which such information would reasonably be understood to be confidential.  Confidential Information may include information disclosed in confidence to Discloser by third parties.  For the purposes of this Agreement, the Licensed Software, and the results of any performance, functional or other evaluation of the Licensed Software, shall be deemed Confidential Information of Intelec AI. 
6.2.	Exceptions.  The confidentiality obligations in this Section 7 shall not apply with respect to any of the Discloser’s Confidential information which Recipient can demonstrate: (a) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed to Recipient or has become in the public domain through no act or omission of Recipient; (b) was known to Recipient, without restriction, at the time of disclosure as shown by the files of Recipient in existence at the time of disclosure; (c) was disclosed by Recipient with the prior written approval of Discloser; (d) was independently developed by Recipient without any use of Discloser’s Confidential Information by employees or other agents of (or contractors hired by) Recipient who had no access to or did not rely on Discloser’s Confidential Information; or (e) became known to Recipient, without restriction, from a source other than Discloser without breach of this Agreement by Recipient and otherwise not in violation of Discloser’s rights.
6.3.	Restrictions on Use and Disclosure. Recipient agrees not to use Discloser’s Confidential Information or disclose, distribute or disseminate Discloser’s Confidential Information except in furtherance of the performance of its obligations or enforcement of its rights hereunder or as otherwise expressly agreed by Discloser in writing.  Recipient agrees to restrict access to such Confidential Information to those employees or consultants of Recipient who need to know such Confidential Information for performing as contemplated hereunder and have agreed in writing to be bound by a confidentiality obligation no less protective than that contained in this Agreement.  Recipient shall exercise the same degree of care to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser’s Confidential Information to others as it takes to preserve and safeguard its own information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care.
6.4.	Compelled Disclosure. If Recipient is compelled by a court or other competent authority or applicable law to disclose Confidential Information of Discloser, it shall give Discloser prompt written notice and shall provide Discloser with reasonable cooperation at Discloser’s expense so that Discloser may take steps to oppose such disclosure or obtain a restraining order.  Recipient shall not be in breach of its obligations in this Section 7 if it makes any legally compelled disclosure provided that Recipient meets the foregoing notice and cooperation requirements.
6.5.	Injunctive Relief.  Recipient acknowledges that breach of the confidentiality obligations would cause irreparable harm to Discloser, the extent of which may be difficult to ascertain.  Accordingly, Recipient agrees that Discloser is entitled to immediate injunctive relief in the event of breach of an obligation of confidentiality by Recipient, and that Discloser shall not be required to post a bond or show irreparable harm in order to obtain such injunctive relief.
6.6.	Return of Confidential Information. As between the parties, Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Discloser.  At any time, upon Discloser’s reasonable request, Recipient shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days) return to Discloser or destroy, at the election of the Discloser, any Confidential Information of the Discloser.  In addition, within 30 days after termination of this Agreement, Recipient shall (i) promptly return all tangible materials containing such Confidential Information to Discloser, (ii) remove all Confidential Information (and any copies thereof) from any computer systems of the Recipient, its contractors and its distributors, and confirm in writing that all materials containing Confidential Information have been destroyed or returned to Discloser, as applicable, by Recipient.  Recipient shall cause its affiliates, agents, contractors, and employees to strictly comply with the foregoing.
